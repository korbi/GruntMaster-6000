Things showed on uml was writed in xml file.
To not rewrite some things many times I used 'extends' attribute,
to mark that node is extending another one.
I also used 'abstract' node to mark this one nodes which exists
only for my convenience.
Attribute 'playable' is used to mark nodes which value should not be
specify by configuration editor but map editor or in game.

compileconfig.py is making a standard file from my specific xml,
this compiled version should be used in game and configuration editor.
